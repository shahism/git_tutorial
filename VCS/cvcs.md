# Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

## Central Repository: 
- `CVCS` have a `single`, `central repository` that stores the `entire project history`. 

- This repository can reside on a dedicated server or on a developer's machine, `accessible to authorized users.`
## Workflow: 
### Developers work by:
- Checking out a local copy of the latest version from the central repository.
- Making changes to the local copy.
- Checking in their changes back to the central repository. 
- Potentially after resolving conflicts if other developers made changes concurrently.

# Facts About CVCS 
## Single source of truth: 
- All changes are stored in one central location.
## Simple setup and easy access control:
- Ideal for small teams or projects with limited complexity.
# Limited offline capability 
- Requires a network connection to access the central repository.
# Centralized failure point: 
- If the central server fails, the entire project history and access to ongoing work may be compromised.

# Examples
## Git: 
- The `most popular DVCS globally`, known for its `flexibility`, `powerful branching features`, and `large community support`.
- It's widely used for `software development`, `web development`, and various other project types.
## Mercurial: 
- Another popular DVCS with a simpler syntax than Git, making it easier to learn initially. 
- It offers similar features and functionalities as Git.
