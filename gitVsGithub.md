# Git Vs GitHub

`Git` and `GitHub` are both related to `version control` and `source code management`, but they serve different purposes.

- Here are the key differences between Git and GitHub:

---

## Git

- Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes in their source code during software development.
- It is a command-line tool that runs locally on your computer. It does not require a network connection to function.
- Git provides a set of commands to create repositories, commit changes, branch and merge code, and collaborate with others.
- It stores all the version history and code changes locally on your machine, allowing you to work offline and commit changes to your local repository.
- Git enables branching and merging, which allows developers to create separate code branches, work on them independently, and merge changes back into the main branch.
- It supports various workflows, including centralized, decentralized, and distributed models.
- Git does not provide a user interface by default, although there are several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available that wrap around the command-line functionality.

## GitHub

- GitHub is a web-based hosting platform and a service that utilizes Git for version control.
- It provides a centralized repository hosting service, allowing developers to store their Git repositories remotely on the GitHub servers.
- GitHub offers a web-based graphical interface that simplifies Git operations and provides additional collaboration features.
- It allows developers to create public or private repositories, manage issues and project boards, track bugs, and facilitate collaboration among team members.
- GitHub provides features such as pull requests, which enable developers to propose changes, review code, and merge them into the main repository.
- It offers social coding features, allowing developers to follow projects, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.
- GitHub provides additional functionalities like continuous integration, code hosting, and deployment tools through integrations with other services.
- While GitHub offers a free tier, it also provides paid plans with additional features, storage, and support for organizations and enterprises.

## Do we have Other Web Based Git Repositories Hosting platforms?

There are many platforms but most of the famous after GitHub are given below:

## GitLab:

- GitLab is a web-based DevOps platform that provides a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) solution along with Git repository hosting. It offers both self-hosted and cloud-hosted options.

## Bitbucket:

- Bitbucket is a Git-based code hosting and collaboration platform that offers both Git and Mercurial repository hosting. It provides features like pull requests, code reviews, and integrations with other Atlassian tools like Jira and Trello.

## Azure DevOps:

- Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS) is a cloud-based platform by Microsoft that offers a wide range of features for software development and DevOps practices. It includes Git repository hosting, build pipelines, release management, and project tracking tools.
